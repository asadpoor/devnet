!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Docker image vs. container !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A Docker image is like a template or snapshot.
An image could contain Ansible + Python + Netmiko pre-installed. Think of it like a prebuilt ISO that’s ready to deploy.

A Docker container is a running instance of an image.
It’s like a virtual device booted from the image, isolated and lightweight.


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Docker Installation !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

# To run Docker commands without sudo on Ubuntu, you need to add your user to the docker group

# check if docker group exist
getent group docker

# add if docker group does not exist
sudo groupadd docker

# add your user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER 

# Logout and log back in.

# Test Docker without sudo
docker run hello-world

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Docker Registry !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A Docker registry is a storage and sharing hub for Docker images.

Think of it like a repository for IOS images or Ansible playbooks, but for Docker images instead.

| Registry Type | Example                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Public        | Docker Hub                                 |
| Private       | GitLab Container Registry, Harbor, AWS ECR, Forgejo |
