pyATS Blitz: a feature of the Cisco pyATS framework that allows network engineers to automate network testing using
a low-code, YAML-based approach

Blitz YAML File Structure:
Testcases: Composed of multiple test sections.
Test Sections: Include a series of actions, which are individual tasks (e.g., executing commands, parsing output).
Popular actions: execute, configure, parse, learn, api, diff.

Output Handling: Outputs can be filtered (e.g., using Dq, regex, or list filters),
saved to variables, files, or dictionaries, and reused across actions.

Filters:
Dq Filter: Extracts values from JSON/dictionary structures.
RegEx Filter: Extracts string patterns or matches multiple items.
List Filter: Targets specific elements in a list.


Advanced Actions:
Parallel Execution: Run multiple actions concurrently.
Looping: Iterate actions based on lists, dictionaries, or conditions.
Run Conditions: Conditional execution based on logical evaluations.
Prompt Handling: Automate responses to device prompts.
