docker run alpine
# Show that it exits immediately (docker ps -a)

# 1. Interactive Shell
docker run -it alpine sh
# show a container can stay alive interactively
# type "exit" to see container stops
# Show with "docker ps -a" the stopped container


# 2. tail -f /dev/null Trick
# tail -f /dev/null continuously reads from /dev/null, which never produces data. Since the command never exits, the containerâ€™s main process stays running.
docker run -d --name alpine-tail alpine tail -f /dev/null
docker ps
# exec into the container
docker exec -it alpine-tail sh
