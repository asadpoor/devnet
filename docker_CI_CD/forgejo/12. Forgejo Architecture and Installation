 - Database: supports SQLite (default), MySQL, PostgreSQL
 - Forgejo Registry = store and share software packages and Docker images, similar to Docker Hub 
- Forgejo Runner = executes workflows (uses DinD if pipelines need Docker builds).
 - Docker-in-Docker: execute pipelines inside DinD containers
