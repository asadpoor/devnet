Forgejo Workflow Triggers define when and how a workflow should start running.
They are special keywords under the on: section of a workflow file (e.g., .forgejo/workflows/main.yml or .github/workflows/main.yml).

A trigger listens for specific repository events (like a push or pull request), time-based schedules, or manual actions from the user interface â€” and automatically starts the workflow when those conditions are met.

# workflow example with different common triggers
name: Hello Workflow2

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger on push to main branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger on pull requests targeting main branch
  schedule:
    - cron: "*/1 * * * *"  # Runs every 1 Minute 
  workflow_dispatch:     # Allows manual triggering from the UI

jobs:
  say-hello:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04   # runner selection

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
