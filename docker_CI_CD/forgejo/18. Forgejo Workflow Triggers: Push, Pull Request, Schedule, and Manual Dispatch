# Forgejo Workflow Triggers define when and how a workflow should start running.
# They are special keywords under the on: section of a workflow file (e.g., .forgejo/workflows/main.yml or .github/workflows/main.yml).
# A trigger listens for specific repository events (like a push or pull request), time-based schedules, or manual actions from the user interface — and automatically starts the workflow when those conditions are met.
