!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How Runner Label wokrs?
# A runner label is just a name (or tag) that tells Github on which runner a job should run.

| Runner   | Labels                                          |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| runner-1 | `self-hosted`, `linux`, `ubuntu`                |
| runner-2 | `self-hosted`, `linux`, `ubuntu`, `high-memory` |
| runner-3 | `self-hosted`, `windows`                        |

# Example 1:
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, ubuntu, high-memory]

# will only be eligible to run on runner-2.
# If several runners match the labels, GitHub’s controller automatically selects one at random
# If no runner is online with those labels → the job stays queued until a matching runner comes online.

# Example 2:
runs-on: self-hosted
# then any self-hosted runner (no matter what other labels it has) can pick up the job.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Install GitHub self-hosted runner
https://github.com/asadpoor/test

Settings > Actions > Runners > New self-hosted runner > Linux

# Download
# Create a folder under the drive root
$ mkdir actions-runner; cd actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package

# Configure
# Create the runner and start the configuration experience
$ ./config.cmd --url https://github.com/asadpoor/test --token $TOKEN
# Run it!
$ ./run.cmd

# Using your self-hosted runner
# Use this YAML in your workflow file for each job
runs-on: self-hosted



# Remove and clean up machine (recommended)
./config.sh remove --token $TOKEN


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Workflow Example 1: runn job on self-hosted runner
name: workflow 1

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  test-runner:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - name: Print a message
        run: |
          echo "Hello from self-hosted runner!"
          sleep 111

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Workflow Example 2: runn job on a docker container on self-hosted runner
name: workflow 2

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    container:
      image: ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:act-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Run simple process
        run: |
          echo "Hello from self-hosted runner!"
          sleep 109
